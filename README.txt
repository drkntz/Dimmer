This project started as a proof of concept for a microprocessor-controlled triac dimmer. The original board was made in 
Kicad by me because I wanted to learn how to layout a board and because I wanted to experiment with both the AC dimmer
and a DC-DC switching power supply using the linkswitch LNK3206. Therefore, while this project in the end is just meant to 
be a dimmer board for use with a raspberry pi, the rev 0 circuit also contains a 5v non isolated power supply.

This project was a sort of proof of concept for something that I later ended up making for work. While I ended up using the 
main driver circuit from this project in that project, that project is drawn in a different EDA program and contains additional 
and more sophisticated circuitry specific to the customer's wishes. Of course, it is also copyrighted.

This board is intended for use as a device for use with a Raspberry Pi or similar microcontroller board, and is designed to be
used with a load of roughly 2 Amps at 120VAC, 60Hz. 

More README to come.
